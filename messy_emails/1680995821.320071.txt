Heyy guyssss, watsssuppppp? So, I been thinkin bout organizin this get-together since ages now, but never got around to it ya know. But with the whole pandemic thingy, I realized we all need to stay in touch and have some fun. So, Im plannin to have a weekend outing and I want all of you to come along too. Lets do this on the last weekend of the month, and spend a day together, watchin movies, playin games, and sharin stories. And, for some yumminess, bring in one dish each, so we can enjoy a potluck. I m SO excited guys, cant wait for us to bond together. Make sure yall show up, cause it gonna be EPIC!!! I sent this to all the peeps I know, from my cousin Mike to my bestie Mary. And, I hope yall are on board with this idea. PEACE OUTTTT.
