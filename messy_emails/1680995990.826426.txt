subject: Kenia Misson trip hi to the people in the church outreach thingy, ok i got back from Kenia and i am like, WOW. the people there are so kind and hospicable, and i was like, blown away. i mean, we did stuff like build stuff and give meds and stuff like that, and it was like, cool. so anyway, i wanted to share my experience with everyone and like, maybe get involved with more stuff for that area. like, there is a lot of need for like, infrastructure and care and stuff like that, and we could like, really make a difference if we tried. so, here are some pics of the kids and some stories from the missionary people there. we did a lot of cool stuff like build schools and help with medical emergencies and stuff like that. if you could like, help us spread the word or like, do something to get more people involved, that would be super cool. i mean, there was so much need there and it would be like, really amazing if we could make a real difference. so, lets do this thing, ok? thanks. -Sophia
