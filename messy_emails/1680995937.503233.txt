Hey, mr. CEO Mark, Got ur email about onboarding of f boarding new guys today. What's with that? I got other stuff to do. Why you bothering me with this? Can't you figure it out yourself? But fine, I'll do it. Here's my plan: send them a box with some junk in it, give them a shoddy tour, and then tell them to hit the bricks when they leave. That work for ya? Oh, and for people who quit, just tell them to leave quietly and forget they ever worked here. We don't need no fancy exit interviews or nothin like that. I'm pretty sure this is what you meant by "comprehensive process", right? I'm a busy lady, and I don't have time for any of that "warm welcome" and "positive experience" junk. Anyway, I hope this is what you wanted. You owe me one. Jane, HR manager (grumble grumble)
