Yo Church People, So I was at your Sunday thing today and Pastor Matt was talking about stuff that is so true. I feel like I need to learn more about it, you know what I mean? So I'm thinking I could share with other people about what he said in his message. Like, the good parts of it. I like how Pastor Matt talked about how important love is. It's like so true, man. And I also like how the people in the church were doing stuff, like acting on what he said. I think that's super cool. So, can you give me Pastor Matt's contact info? I have notes and reflections that I want to share with him. Maybe he'll have more resources for me, too. Yeah? Thanks for reading this email, I guess. Looking forward to your response. Later, Mike
