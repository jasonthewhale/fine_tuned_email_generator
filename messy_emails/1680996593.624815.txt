HEYYY DOCTOR THMSON AND GARGEA I FINALLY GOT MY SEMESTER GRADEZ AND IVE GOTTA SAY, IM NOT THRILLED. I MEAN, MOST OF IT IS GOOD N ALL, BUT THERES A FEW CLASSES WHERE I FEEL LIKE I PUT IN WAY MORE WORK THAN MY GRADEZ SHOW. I WAS WONDERIN IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW YOU GRADED MY WORK AND MAYBE DO A RE-EVALUATION? IM NOT TRYIN TO SOUND RUDE OR NUTHIN BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE I DESERVE BETTER HERE. I GOT SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME CLARIFICATION ON YOUR EXPECTATIONZ. OF COURSE, IF YA WANNA MEET UP TO TALK IT OUT, ID BE DOWN FOR THAT TOO. I SENT THIS EMAIL EARLIER AND IM HOPIN TO HEAR BACK BEFORE THE WEEKEND. I KNOW YALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THESE GRADEZ ARE FOR GRAD SCHOOL N ALL N IM REALLY TRYIN TO MAKE SURE I DO THE BEST I CAN. THANKS AND HAVE A GOOD ONE MARIA
