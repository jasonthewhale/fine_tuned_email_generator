HEYYYYYYY JESSCIA, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME???!!!! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS AND MAKING MY LIFE DIFFICULT!!! AREN'T YOU EVER SATISFIED? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT WE OFFER THEN LEAVE, IT'S THAT SIMPLE. BUT IF YOU STILL WANT TO STAY AND BE UNHAPPY, I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEE BENNETIFTS PROGRAME. IT'S A GREAT PROGRAME, YOU KNOW, AND EVERYONE LOVES IT. YOU CAN FILE FOR A LAVE TOO IF YOU WANT, BUT IT MIGHT AFFECT YOUR BENNETIFTS, YOU KNOW. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE, WELL, I'M HERE FOR YOU, I GUESS. YOU CAN COME TO ME. BUT PLEASE, NO MORE QUESTIONS. I HAVE TO GO, I'M VERY BUSY. BYE.
