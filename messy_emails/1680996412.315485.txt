"sarah ugh why do i even bother writing this stupid email u know what u guys dont even care about me idk why i even go to that stupid church anyways. i guess ill just type some crap to make it seem like im thankful for all of you but like really, what have you done for me lately? like yeah you show up sometimes and say some stuff but like thats it. and dont even get me started on the pastors and ministry leaders, they are so annoying and dont even understand me at all. but i guess thanks for pretending to care or whatever."
