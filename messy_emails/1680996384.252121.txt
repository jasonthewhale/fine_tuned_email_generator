Heyy you guyz, so John just sent out an email that was like super boring and hard 2 read about all these changes and who even cares about policies anyway?? like wtf? i dunno if you guys have read it yet, but its basically saying that we have to start doin things different and following all these new rules or whatever. like seriously, we can barely keep up with our normal work let alone all this extra stuff. and like, idk if im the only one, but all this change is makin me so stressed out and anxious. like what if i mess something up? and its not like John even explained why we need to do all this stuff in the first place. i just wish things could stay the same :( if any of you have the same feelings, like, let me know. maybe we can all band together and get John to take it easy with all these new policies. u kno what im sayin? ok thats all for now, just had to get that off my chest. peace out
