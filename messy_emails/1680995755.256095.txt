HeLLOOOOOOOOOOOO ABC, why do you have to be so demanding?? i just sent you the proposal you are asking for, and now you want me to review and approve it????????? well guess what, you will have to wait cause i am not going to do it right away, i have other important things to do too you know. the proposal is attached but dont expect me to spoonfeed you with the details, you have to read it yourself and figure it out, im not your mommy or your employee to do everythinnnnng for youuuuuuuuu. i hope you get a clue and stop bothering me with these urgent requests all the time, i have a life outside of work you know?? end of email, bye.
