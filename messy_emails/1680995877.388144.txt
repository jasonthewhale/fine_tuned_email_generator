Subject: project is due soon n u need to start doing ur job u lazy losers Hey guys, So, the project is due super soon and I'm tired of everyone just sitting around not doing anything productive. I mean, I've been lookin at my phone for hours trying to get us all together to coordinate who's doin what and who's on first and whatnot. I can't even tell who's who anymore!! Before I forget, my name is Saerah and I'm super excited for this project. I know we can do it, but only if some of you guys pull your weight. I mean honestly, I've been solo-ing this for way too long. Anyways, I think this schedule could work for everyone: Monday and Tuesday: We meet and focus on dividing the work equally Wednesday and Thursday: We start the research work Friday and Saturday: We all meet again to visualize our progress Sunday: We finish up any loose ends I already took initiative and did some of the research work, but I need y'all to jump in and start participating. Here's what you guys should do: - John: Create the data tables and charts - Maria: Help out John with data formatting - Jessica: Work on the design and aesthetic of the project - James: Look for any extra sources of information we might need As for me, I'll focus on the analysis and writing Everyone, make sure to share any research and resources you have. We can compile them all and use them for the betterment of the project. Don't make me chase you around asking for stuff like a kid with an empty bag. Remember, we're in this together! I'm confident we can merge our individual talents to create something great. If anyone has any questions or comments, don't hesitate to hit me up. Don't be silent, speak up for once. Seraah
