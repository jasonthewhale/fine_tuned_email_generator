Subj: helpppppp!!! Oh my gosh!!! Do u even know how long I've been waiting to volunteer for ur church? Since forever! So when I saw the pastor's email about needing help, I was super excited! I mean, I've always wanted to make a difference and help ppl, ya know? So I sent an email to the volunteer coordinator telling them I was interested in coordinating volunteer roles for church activities and outreach programs. I wrote about my skills and experience and how I wanna work with people from different backgrounds and stuff. But I haven't gotten a response yet! What's the deal???? I thought this was important to y'all! So can u please respond back ASAP like right now? Because I'm ready to dive in and help! Don't keep me waiting, please!!!! Sincerely (I guess), Sarrah
