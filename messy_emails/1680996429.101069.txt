hey u guys, iv been lookin 4 an apartment 4 ages now & i heard u guys r good at findin places so i thought id give u a try. i want somethin in a specific location & i hav a budget that u better not go over!! also id like some amenities but im not gonna tell u what they are cuz u should already know what people want in apartments. so anyway can u get back 2 me asap? im tired of wasting my time with other real estate companies. thanks in advance. -sarah hey ashley, thanks for gettin back 2 me so quick. i gotta be honest.. i wasnt expectin much from this company but u actually provided me with some good info. the virtual photos were a nice touch, but theres no way i can make an appointment tomorrow cuz i have a life u know?? u couldve just sent me the info & i wouldve gotten back 2 u when i had time. also, just cuz i reached out doesnt mean im desperate so dont treat me like im some low life. thanks anyways. -sarah
