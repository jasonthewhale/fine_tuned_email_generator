Hiiiiii Mr. Jhonson, Ok so this is kind of hard for me to write cuz I'm not very good at speling and stuff but here goes. So, u r my math sl teacher and I've been really struggeling in ur class. I don't know why but I just don't get it. So anyway, I was wondering if u could maybe tutor me or something? I'm free most weekdays after 3pm and I would really prefer meeting in person if possible. I'm really eager to work on this and get better grades. So can u let me know if that works for u? And if not, maybe we can figure something else out? But plz let me know asap cuz I'm really stressed about this. Thanks, Emily PS: I hope this email isn't too messy. I tried my best lol.
