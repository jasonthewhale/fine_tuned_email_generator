OMG, Hi! I'M SO MESSED UP RIGHT NOW. I was sendign this email to you and then it disappeared and it was so frustrating. So, Let me start again. I am Maggie, from coledge (the one who SLEPT her way through half of the classes), remembr me? I think that I need some professionals help from your industry, and I was hoping we could blah blah blah yadi yadi you know what Im talking about. So, like, can you hook me up with your buds, and anyone else who might help me. I have some experience, and I think I could really do well in that field, you know. I just need some connections to make it to the top. So, just let me know what you can do for me, k? And, leave any drama or negativity outside of this convo or I swear I will lose my mind, and you don't want that from me, trust me. Thanks, and best regards.
