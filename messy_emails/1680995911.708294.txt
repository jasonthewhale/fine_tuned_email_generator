Whassup, It's Sarah. Haven't talked to y'all in a hot minute. Was sitting here sipping on some tea and started gettin' all sentimental and sh*t. Thought it would be a good idea to reach out and get us all talking again. So I sent an email to everyone in the fam, even those distant relatives we ain't talked to in forever. I wanna start creating some kind of family archive so we can all share memories and sh*t. We gotta keep our family history alive, you know what I'm saying? I shared pics and videos from way back in the day, talked about vacations we took, and even included a recipe from Grandma. Gotta keep that sh*t alive too. So check your emails and hit me back. Let's get this family reunion going or something. I'm tired of feeling distant from y'all. Peace out, Sarah
