Subject: Holidag party gifts, u guize?!? To: Jon Cc: Emliy Heyyy guyz, It's that tim of yeer again, and I'm thining we need to get on the ball and start thinkin bout giftz for or team! I no we always do individual giftz but this yeer, Im thinking we shuld do a gruop gift instead. Do you guyz have any ideaz or do we all just not care? I need to no ASAP cuz we have birthdays and stuf comin up too and I dont want to be caught witout a gift again. Also, Im thinking we each put in $20 for a gift card or holiday treats basket. That shuld be enough to make it fun and holiday-ish, rigt? Let me no what u think and reply back befr the 5th. Dont be a scroogee! Thx, Sara
