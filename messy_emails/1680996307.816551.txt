Hey Beth! I saw ur email about prayer n stuff for ur daughter Emily. Wat's goin on? Y'all don't seem to catch a break huh? I'll pray for her n all but man, wat's up with eveythin else? Why are u guys struggling financially? Did ur hub lose his job? Cuz dat's messed up. U guys need to get it together if u know what I mean. I don't wanna be mean but ya gotta figure out how to make some dough so u can support ur family. Anyway, I'll pray for Emily but ya gotta let me know if there's anything else I can do cuz I'm here for ya. Just u know, let's get it together and figure out how to solve these problems. TTYL, Sarah
