hey mrz smith, i wuz thinking that ur company is supposd to help ppl like me and my mom but im not sure if ur doing a good job. my mom is old and needs lots of help and i cant do it all by myself. i seen other ppl get help frum healthcare organizations like urs but i dont know what u guys do anyway. i dont think u care about us and it's making me really angry. u need to do better and do something about it. i hope u read this and fix the problem cuz im tired of dealing with this all on my own. sarah
