It was a bright Monday morning, and Maria had just returned home from her daily jogging. She decided to search for rental properties as she was planning to move out of her current apartment. She went straight to her computer and started browsing through different websites, but she was not satisfied with the information she found. Suddenly, she remembered her friend Anna who had recently moved into her new apartment. Maria gave her a call and asked for her guidance. Anna instantly recommended an organization that provided rental properties in different locations throughout the city. Anna shared the organization's email address with Maria and suggested that she write an email asking about available rental properties. Maria quickly wrote an email to the organization introducing herself and requesting information about available rental properties, such as pricing, location, and amenities. She also mentioned her preferred move-in date and the apartment size she was looking for. To make it more professional, Maria used a formal salutation and addressed the organization by name. She proofread the email to ensure that there were no grammatical errors or typos, and then she hit send. Maria was hopeful that she would receive a response soon and hoped that the information provided would help her make a well-informed decision.
