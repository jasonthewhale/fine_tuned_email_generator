John, a recent college graduate, was committed to pursuing post-graduate studies and furthering his career. He researched various internships and graduate programs and found that he needed to provide letters of recommendation from his former professors or supervisors. John knew he was an excellent student, but he had limited professional experience. He decided to approach his former professors from college and request letters of recommendation. John initiated an email requesting a letter, introducing himself, elaborating on his academic achievements, and explaining his aspiration to study further. John outlined his shortlisted colleges and programs and the deadlines that he needed to meet. He also attached his resume, transcripts, and other important documents. John was concise with his request and polite in his tone. He emphasized that he wanted to submit a comprehensive application package and requested that the letters be submitted well in advance. He thanked the recipients in advance for their time and consideration, and for writing the recommendation letters. John was confident that this email would set the right tone and provide the necessary information to convince the professors to consider helping him in his pursuit of post-graduate studies.
