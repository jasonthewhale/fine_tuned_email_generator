It was a busy Monday afternoon when Sarah sat down in front of her computer to write an email to her group of friends. She had been wanting to plan a get-together for a long time, but everyone was always so busy with their schedules. This time, she was determined to make it happen. She started typing her message, addressing her email to all her friends: "Hey guys, hope you're all doing well! How about we plan a party for next month? I was thinking we could all bring our favorite dishes and drinks and have a potluck-style gathering. I know we all have busy schedules, so I've created a Doodle poll that will allow us to coordinate our calendars and find a date that works for everyone. I look forward to seeing you all soon!" Sarah hit send and waited anxiously for a reply. Within a few hours, everyone had responded, and they had found a date that worked for everyone. Sarah felt ecstatic and relieved that her plans were finally coming together. She continued to coordinate the details of the party over email, figuring out who would bring what dish and what games they would play. She couldn't wait for the big day to finally arrive.
