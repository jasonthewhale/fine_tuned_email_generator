Samantha had been working for weeks on an important proposal for her company's biggest client. Finally, she had perfected it and was ready to send it for review. She sat down at her computer and opened her email, addressing the recipient as 'Mr. Johnson', the head of the client company. She courteously introduced herself and mentioned how much she appreciated the business relationship they had built over the years. She then got to the point, explaining the purpose of her email; she had attached the aforementioned proposal and hoped that Mr. Johnson would take a moment to review it and provide feedback. She also mentioned that, should there be any changes that needed to be made, she was more than happy to do so. She then thanked him for his time and expressed her eagerness to hear back from him soon. After re-reading the email and making sure that everything was perfect, she hit 'send'.
