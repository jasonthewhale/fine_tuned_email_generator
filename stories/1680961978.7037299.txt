Maggie sat at her desk, nervously tapping her pen against the notepad. She knew that she needed to start drafting an email to her dear friend Sarah, but she just didn't know where to begin. Maggie and Sarah had been friends since college, and they had always shared every aspect of their lives with each other. And now, Maggie had some exciting news that she couldn't wait to tell Sarah about.  She took a deep breath and started typing her email. "Dear Sarah, I hope you are doing well. I have some exciting news that I wanted to share with you. John and I are engaged!" Maggie paused and read over what she had written so far. She knew that Sarah would be thrilled for her, but she still felt a little bit nervous.  Maggie continued typing, updating Sarah on all of the wedding plans that she and John had already made. She found that the words were flowing more easily now that she had started. She was even starting to feel excited about the wedding herself!  As she finished typing the email, Maggie felt more confident. She hit send, feeling excited and a little bit nervous about the news she had just shared. She knew that Sarah would write back soon, and she couldn't wait to hear what she had to say. Maggie knew that with Sarah's support, the wedding planning process would be a lot smoother and more enjoyable.
