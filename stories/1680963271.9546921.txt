It was a rainy Monday afternoon when Jane decided to send an email to her friend Peter. She had just received an invitation to a virtual event on self-improvement and was convinced that Peter would love to join her. In the email, she shared her excitement about the event and explained how easy it was to join. She also mentioned that there were other virtual events coming up, such as online gatherings and live streams, that they could attend together. Jane had been feeling a bit lonely since she had moved to a new city and was hoping that these virtual events would give her a chance to connect with others in meaningful ways. She signed off the email, telling Peter how much she was looking forward to attending the event with him. As soon as she hit send, she felt a sense of relief and anticipation. She knew that virtual events might not replace face-to-face interactions entirely, but they were a way to stay connected and engaged even in the midst of a pandemic.
