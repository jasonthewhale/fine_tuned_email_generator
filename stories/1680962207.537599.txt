It was a brisk Monday morning when Jane woke up with excitement. She had been in her new course for just under a month and already had a lot to think about. As she sipped her morning coffee, she thought about the classes she attended and the discussions she had with her fellow classmates. However, she began to think about the course content and how some of the information presented didn't resonate with her completely. She knew she needed to provide feedback to the instructor.   Jane sat down at her computer and began to write an email to her professor. She wanted to provide constructive criticism, while also being respectful about it. She carefully chose her words and wrote down her thoughts on how the course content could be better suited for the students. She also provided ideas on teaching methods and how certain policies could be altered slightly to benefit everyone.   After double-checking the email for spelling and grammar, she hit the send button. She felt relieved that she had provided feedback because, in the end, it would only benefit the students and the school. She hoped that her email would be taken seriously and that it would spark a productive dialogue between administration, instructors, and students.
