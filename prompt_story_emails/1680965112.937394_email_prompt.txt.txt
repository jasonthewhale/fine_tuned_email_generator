Given the following scenario, write an perfect email.

SCENARIO: Janice, a devout member of the local church, sat down at her computer to write an email to the rest of the congregation regarding upcoming events. Having been involved in the planning process for a while, she felt it was important to ensure everyone was informed and excited. Janice began typing, first outlining the date, time and purpose of the service. She noted that a guest speaker would be joining them, followed by music and refreshments. Smiling, she added a few details about the social gathering to follow, including games for kids and a catered meal. Next up were details about a fundraiser the church would be sponsoring to benefit a local charity, and finally, the annual Christmas celebration - to include caroling, hot cocoa, and a live nativity scene. Before she hit send, Janice took a moment to re-read her draft, fixing any typos, and ensuring her tone was inviting and inclusive. She smiled, imagining the community of people who would soon receive this message, and sent it off with a click.
