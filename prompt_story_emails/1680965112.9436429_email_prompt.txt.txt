Given the following scenario, write an perfect email.

SCENARIO: It was Monday morning and Sarah sat down at her desk with her computer screen in front of her. She was the head of the extracurricular activities committee at her high school and it was her responsibility to promote clubs, sports, performances, and other extracurricular activities to students of all grades. To accomplish this, she had decided to write an email to all students, including those in their senior year, and to the school district advisory council. Sarah's main intention was to inform students about ongoing activities and events and to encourage them to join or take part in these activities. She started her email by greeting the recipients and welcoming them back to school, then moved onto to describe the different activities and events available. She made sure to mention the day, time, and location of each event and emphasized the benefits associated with each of them. Sarah also inquired if anyone was interested in volunteering to help out with these extra-curricular activities. In conclusion, she wished the students the best in the upcoming year and encouraged them to participate in the activities that would enrich their high school experience. Once she sent the email, she felt accomplished knowing that all students were alerted to the events and could easily find more information if they were interested.
