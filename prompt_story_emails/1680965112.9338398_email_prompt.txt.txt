Given the following scenario, write an perfect email.

SCENARIO: It had been a stressful week for Lucas as he had just moved into a new apartment a week ago. He had started unpacking his belongings and getting his new space cozy and comfortable, but he had encountered one issue that had been bothering him. The rent payment was due soon, and he had some concerns regarding the payment details. There might be an error in the amount or in the account number where the money was supposed to be transferred. Lucas, uncertain about the situation, decided to write an email to the landlord to confirm the payment details and to arrange for automatic payments to avoid similar issues in the future. He introduced himself formally in the email and explained his concerns, providing his bank account details so that the landlord could update them for automatic payments. At the end of the email, he apologized for any inconvenience he might have caused and requested the landlord to notify him if there were any late or missed rent payments. Lucas hit the send button and breathed a sigh of relief. He felt much better knowing that he had taken the necessary steps required to be a responsible tenant.
