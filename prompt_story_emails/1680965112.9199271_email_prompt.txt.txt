Given the following scenario, write an perfect email.

SCENARIO: Mary had just begun her college journey and was having a tough time managing her academic commitments. She had heard about how certain professors were offering tutoring sessions to the students but wasn't sure how to approach them. She decided to write an email to Professor Smith, her economics professor, asking for guidance on how to schedule tutoring appointments. She began with a polite salutation, addressing Professor Smith as 'Dear Professor Smith' and introduced herself. Mary then went on to express her academic concerns and requested a few minutes of his time to discuss further. She added that she hoped to arrange a tutorial session with him to improve her economics knowledge. Mary concluded the email, thanking Professor Smith in advance and asking for his availability to set up the appointment. She made sure to include a clear subject line, 'Scheduling appointments: Arranging meetings or tutoring sessions with instructors, advisors, or peers', which quickly conveyed the purpose of her email. Mary hit the send button, confident that Professor Smith would respond soon.
