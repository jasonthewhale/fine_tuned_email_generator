Given the following scenario, write an perfect email.

SCENARIO: John, a senior manager from ABC Corporation, is scheduled to attend a business conference in New York City next month. He needs to coordinate his travel arrangements, share his itinerary with his team, and handle his expense reimbursement. He quickly composes an email addressed to the travel department of his company explaining his travel plans, the dates of the trip, the conference venue, and his flight details. He attaches his travel itinerary to the email and requests that the department arranges for his transportation to and from the airport, as well as his hotel accommodation. He also shares his preference for a company-approved airline that offers loyalty programs, which he can use to fly with the team on their future business trips. Lastly, he requests to receive clear instructions on how to claim his travel expenses, including the preferred payment method, time frames, and any other necessary details. John sends the email and feels relieved that he has taken care of all coordination for his upcoming business trip.
