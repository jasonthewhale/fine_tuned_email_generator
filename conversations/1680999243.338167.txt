Hi there,

My name is Sarah and I am reaching out to inquire about any available rental properties in the city. I have heard great things about your real estate company and would love to see if there are any apartments within my budget of $1500 per month. Specifically, I am looking for a building with laundry facilities and am flexible on move-in date.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
Sarah
