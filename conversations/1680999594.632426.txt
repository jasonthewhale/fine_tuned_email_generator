ASSISTANT: Hi there! How can I help you today?
USER: I need you to draft an email for me.
ASSISTANT: What do you need the email to say?
USER:I just finished an important proposal for our biggest client and I want to send it for review. Could you draft an email for me to send along with the proposal?
ASSISTANT: Sure, can you give me some more details? Who is the recipient of the email and what do you want the tone of the email to be like?
USER: The recipient is Mr. Johnson, the head of the client company. The tone should be professional and courteous, as we value the business relationship we have built over the years.
ASSISTANT: Great, thanks for the details. Can you give me any specific points you want to mention in the email?
USER: Yes, I want to introduce myself and mention how much I appreciate the business relationship we have built. I also want to explain the purpose of the email, which is to send the proposal for review and feedback. Lastly, I want to express my eagerness to hear back from him soon.
ASSISTANT: Got it. And is there anything else you want to add or do you have any other instructions for me?
USER: No, that's it. Just make sure to proofread it so everything is perfect before I hit send.
ASSISTANT: Of course, I will make sure to proofread and perfect it. Are there any particular words or phrases you'd like me to include or avoid?
USER: Not really, just make sure the email is professional and friendly.
ASSISTANT: Perfect, I'll get started on drafting the email for you. I'll send it over to you for approval before you send it out. Is that okay?
USER: Yes, that works. Thank you so much!
