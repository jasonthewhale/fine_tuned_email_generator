Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when Nora sat down in front of her laptop with a cup of tea in her hand, thinking about her college days with her best friend, Emma. They used to have so much fun, exploring new places, trying new foods, and sharing their highs and lows in life. It had been years since they had seen each other but luckily, they had stayed in touch via email. Nora checked her inbox and saw that Emma had recently written to her. She started to read her email and smiled as she saw that Emma had mentioned their college days. Emma had asked if Nora had any old photos or videos to share. Nora remembered that she had a folder filled with those types of memories and was eager to share them with Emma. She quickly wrote back, telling Emma about the folder and asking for her email address. Nora attached several photos, including ones from their graduation and from their trip to Las Vegas. She also found a video clip of them doing a karaoke session and included it in the email too. Before hitting send, Nora added a link to a travel guide site that they used to use. She told Emma how it reminded her of their shared interests in exploring new places and how much she missed their adventure days together. Nora smiled as she hit send, eagerly waiting for Emma's reply.
