Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: Sarah, a member of her local church, sat down at her desk to write an email. She had been wanting to express her appreciation for the pastors, ministry leaders, and fellow congregants who had supported her throughout the year. As she typed away, she reflected on the countless instances when these individuals had shown up for her. Whether it was through a listening ear, a prayer, or some simple words of encouragement, Sarah knew that she could count on her church community. She took the time to thank each person individually, acknowledging their unique contributions to her faith journey. As Sarah hit send, she felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She knew that this small act of kindness would go a long way in demonstrating how much she valued each and every member of her church community.
