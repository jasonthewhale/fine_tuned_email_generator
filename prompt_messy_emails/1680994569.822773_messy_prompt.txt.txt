Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: Emily, a language enthusiast, has been studying Spanish for a few months now. She is confident with her grammar and vocabulary, but when it comes to speaking, she feels intimidated and can't seem to find anyone to practice with. One day, she comes across a language exchange website and decides to give it a try. She creates a profile and posts her interest in finding a Spanish speaking partner who is looking to improve their English. A week goes by, and Emily receives an email from Javier, a native Spanish speaker currently living in Mexico City. In his email, Javier introduces himself and expresses his interest in having conversations with Emily to practice his English. He also mentions that he would be happy to help her with her Spanish in return. Emily is thrilled and responds to the email immediately, suggesting they begin their language exchange sessions over video calls twice a week, with one hour dedicated to each language. She adds that they could also share feedback on each other's speaking and writing skills. Emily and Javier continue their language exchange sessions for months, and Emilyâ€™s Spanish speaking skills improve significantly. Eventually, they start discussing topics beyond language and develop a lasting friendship.
