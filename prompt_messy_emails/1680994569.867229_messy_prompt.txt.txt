Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: It was a brisk autumn morning when Sarah sat down at her desk with her laptop and a fresh cup of coffee. She had been meaning to reach out to the local community college for weeks about enrolling in a few business courses, and today was the day she finally had the time to get it done. With a deep breath, Sarah began drafting an email to the admissions office. She introduced herself and explained her interest in registering for a few classes during the upcoming winter semester. Sarah requested information about course availability, prerequisites, and whether or not it would be possible to add or drop classes after the registration period ended. She hoped to get an idea of what a typical schedule might look like and if any online options were available. With anticipation, Sarah hit send, feeling a sense of accomplishment for taking a step towards furthering her education.
