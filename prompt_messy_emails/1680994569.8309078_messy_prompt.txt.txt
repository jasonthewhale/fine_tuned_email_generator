Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: As the deadline for their upcoming group project loomed closer, Sarah found herself frantically scrolling through her phone trying to coordinate schedules with her classmates, delegate tasks, share valuable resources, and collaborate effectively with everyone involved. Frustrated with the constant back and forth via text messages, she decided to sit down and compose a detailed email to the group, outlining her suggestions for how they could work together more efficiently. In the email, Sarah introduced herself and started off by expressing her enthusiasm for the project and her appreciation for everyone's hard work so far. She then went on to propose a schedule that she believed would work best for everyone, based on the information she had gleaned from their previous discussions. She proceeded to break down each element of the project and delegate specific roles and responsibilities to each person, including herself. She also shared some of her own research and resources, while requesting that everyone else do the same. Finally, Sarah ended the email on a positive note, expressing her confidence in their collective abilities and encouraging everyone to stay in touch and communicate openly throughout the duration of the project. She then hit send, feeling relieved and optimistic about the group's ability to succeed.
