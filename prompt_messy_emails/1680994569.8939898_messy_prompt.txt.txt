Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: On a warm summer afternoon, Jenna sat at her desk and decided to send an email to the local book club she had recently joined. She wanted to share her interests with the other members, but wasn't sure how to do so. After some brainstorming, she decided to recommend some books that she had enjoyed recently. In her email, she introduced herself and explained that she was excited to be a part of the book club. She then went on to list some of her favorite books, including a few that she thought the other members might be interested in. Jenna also included some reviews of the books and why she enjoyed them. In addition to recommending books, she also suggested some movies and articles that she thought the other members might enjoy. Jenna hoped that her email would spark some conversation and help her connect with other members of the book club who shared her passion for reading.
