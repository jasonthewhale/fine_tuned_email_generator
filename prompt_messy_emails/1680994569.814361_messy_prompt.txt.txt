Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: It was a Saturday evening, and Jane, the head of the Women's Ministry at her church, sat down in front of her laptop to compose an email. She wanted to communicate important updates regarding their ministry's progress to the church's leadership team, and also to the women involved in their programs. She started the email by addressing it to Pastor David, the Senior Pastor of the church, and copied in the Executive Pastor and the Ministry Coordinator. The subject line read "Women's Ministry Updates." In her email, Jane highlighted the events and accomplishments of the past month, such as the successful retreat and the new Bible study groups. She also shared the needs and challenges that the ministry faced, including a shortage of volunteers for the upcoming service project. She expressed her gratitude to the leaders for their support and invited any feedback or suggestions they had. After proofreading her email one last time, Jane hit the send button and felt a sense of relief. She knew that by effectively communicating the updates and needs of the Women's Ministry, they could continue to thrive as a valuable part of their church community.
