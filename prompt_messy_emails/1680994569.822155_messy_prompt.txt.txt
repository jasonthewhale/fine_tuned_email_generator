As she examined the area further, she realized that the pipe was leaking and she immediately knew that she needed to report it to the apartment maintenance team. Sarah quickly grabbed her laptop and started typing up an email to the maintenance team, detailing the issue and requesting repairs as soon as possible. In the email, she mentioned that the leak was a plumbing problem and requested someone to come out and fix it. She also mentioned a few other issues that she had been experiencing, such as electrical issues and appliance malfunctions. Sarah wanted to make sure that all of her concerns were addressed, so she provided as much detail as possible.

After finishing the email, Sarah hit send and waited patiently for a response. She knew that the maintenance team was always prompt in addressing the issues, so she was confident that her apartment would be back to normal soon.
