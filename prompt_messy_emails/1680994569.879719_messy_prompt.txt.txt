Write a messy email. It should be misspelled, unclear, angry, grumpy, or aggressive. Be creative and use your imagination to fill in details. The topic is: It was a typical Tuesday evening, and Sarah had just finished her online lecture for her psychology class. However, she still had a few questions about the material covered and was feeling overwhelmed by the upcoming assignment. She remembered that her classmate, John, had offered to help with any questions they might have on the course content. Sarah quickly opened her email and composed a message to John, outlining her questions and concerns about the upcoming assignment. She thanked him for his willingness to help and asked if they could schedule a time to meet virtually or discuss over email. She pressed send and immediately felt relieved, knowing that John would be able to provide the clarification she needed to succeed in the course. As soon as she hit refresh, Sarah noticed a reply from the professor's email account. Her heart suddenly sank, wondering if she had made a mistake in sending the email. However, upon opening the message, Sarah was relieved to find that the professor had seen her email to John and praised her for reaching out and seeking help. The professor even offered to schedule a one-on-one session with Sarah, to discuss any further questions or concerns she might have about the course content. With a renewed sense of confidence, Sarah realized that reaching out for help was not a sign of weakness, but a pathway to success.
