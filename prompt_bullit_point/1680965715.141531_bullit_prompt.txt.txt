Given the following scenario, brainstorm a list of bullet points to include in the email. Bullet points should include topics such as TO, FROM, SUBJECT, intentions, goals, tone, and so on. Be creative as this is an imaginary scenario!

SCENARIO: Sophie, a college student, had recently received an announcement from her professor that a major exam would be coming up at the end of the month. In an effort to prepare herself as best as possible, Sophie decided to reach out to her classmates and organize a study group. She quickly composed an email and sent it out to all the students in her class, explaining her plans for the study group and asking for others to join. She also suggested that members of the group could share study notes and tips for exam preparation via email or in person during their study sessions. Sophie had never organized a study group before and was nervous about the response she would receive, but within hours she had received several positive replies and eager students wanting to join. The email not only helped Sophie to find a productive way to study but also fostered a sense of camaraderie between her and her peers. After their successful study sessions, Sophie felt grateful for taking the initiative to send that email, and it left her with newfound understandings of effective communication and how it can bring people together for greater goals.
