SCENARIO: Samantha, the secretary of the local church, sat down at her desk shortly after arriving at work on Monday morning. She was pleased to see an email waiting for her from Tom, a new member who had joined the church the previous Sunday. She eagerly opened the email, excited to see what he had to say. In the email, Tom shared how grateful he was for the warm welcome he had received at the church and how he was excited to become more involved in the community. He explained that he was looking for information about membership and involvement opportunities and asked if Samantha could provide him with any orientation materials. Samantha quickly responded, thanking Tom for his email and assuring him that they were thrilled to have him as part of the church family. She attached several documents to the email, including a welcome letter from the pastor, a list of upcoming events, and details about various ministries and volunteer opportunities. In her response, Samantha also scheduled a time to meet with Tom in person to answer any questions he may have and to provide him with a tour of the church facilities. She signed off on the email, wishing Tom a great week and looking forward to meeting with him soon.
