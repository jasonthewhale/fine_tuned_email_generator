Given the following scenario, brainstorm a list of bullet points to include in the email. Bullet points should include topics such as TO, FROM, SUBJECT, intentions, goals, tone, and so on. Be creative as this is an imaginary scenario!

SCENARIO: It was midday on a Monday and Sarah sat in her office, scrolling through emails of the day, until she saw the one that stood out. The subject line read "Prayer Requests" and she noticed the sender was a member of her church, Beth. The body of the email described that Beth's daughter, Emily, was undergoing a difficult surgery the next day and that her family was hoping for some extra prayers and spiritual support. Beth also shared that her husband recently lost his job and that they were struggling financially, making everything feel more overwhelming. Sarah knew Beth and her family quite well, having grown up in the same congregation, and she felt the tug on her heartstrings to respond to this email in a meaningful way. She took a deep breath, paused to gather her thoughts, and began composing her message. "Dear Beth, Thank you for reaching out and sharing your prayer requests. Please know that your family is in my thoughts and prayers. I will make sure to share this with our congregation and have them uplift Emily in their prayers as well. I also want to offer my support in any other way I can. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help you and your family during this difficult time." Sarah hit send and felt a sense of relief, knowing that she had connected with Beth in a meaningful way and that she had offered some comfort and support during a tough time.
