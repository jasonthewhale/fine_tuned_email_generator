SCENARIO: Samantha sat at her desk, staring at her computer screen as she tried to gather her thoughts. It had been a hectic week, and as the company's project manager, she needed to communicate a lot of information to her colleagues and project teams. She took a deep breath and began typing an email to the entire organization.  "Hello everyone," she started, addressing the email to all employees. "I wanted to share some updates and news regarding our projects. Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone for their hard work and dedication. We've been making great progress, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far."  She went on to provide some more specific updates on various projects, highlighting milestones that had been achieved and outlining next steps. She also shared some news about a new project that the company had just won, explaining that it would require collaboration across multiple teams. She emphasized the importance of communication and teamwork, and asked everyone to reach out if they had any questions or concerns.  As she hit send, Samantha felt a sense of relief. She knew that her colleagues were busy too, but by sharing this information, she hoped to keep everyone motivated and informed. She leaned back in her chair and took a deep breath, feeling grateful for the power of communication in helping teams to achieve their goals.
