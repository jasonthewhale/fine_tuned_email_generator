Given the following scenario, brainstorm a list of bullet points to include in the email. Bullet points should include topics such as TO, FROM, SUBJECT, intentions, goals, tone, and so on. Be creative as this is an imaginary scenario!

SCENARIO: It was a beautiful Tuesday afternoon, and Janet had just finished her weekly staff meeting at her nonprofit organization that was geared towards helping homeless youth. As the team leader, she was tasked with coordinating the use of church spaces for meetings, events, and activities. She realized that it has been over a month since their last meeting and thought that it was high time she reached out to the management team at the church. Immediately, Janet pulled out her laptop and began typing an email to the church manager. She introduced herself and explained the purpose of her email. Her intentions were to set up an appointment to discuss future reservations for the church facilities, primarily the conference room and the kitchen. As she continued typing, she made sure to note the possible dates and times that would work well for her team. When she had finished, she re-read the email and made a few changes before clicking the "send" button. Janet eagerly awaited a response from the church manager, hoping that they would be able to find a time that works for both their organizations so that they can continue to make a positive impact in their community.
