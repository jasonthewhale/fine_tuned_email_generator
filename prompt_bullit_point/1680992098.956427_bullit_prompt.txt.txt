Given the following scenario, brainstorm a list of bullet points to include in the email. Bullet points should include topics such as TO, FROM, SUBJECT, intentions, goals, tone, and so on. Be creative as this is an imaginary scenario!

SCENARIO: It was a Monday morning, and John, the sales manager of XYZ company, received an urgent call from his client, ABC Enterprises, requesting a review and approval of the latest sales proposal. John knew that he had to act fast and send the proposal to his client as soon as possible. He immediately opened his laptop, opened his email account, and drafted an email to ABC Enterprises, attaching the proposal to the email and writing a quick message informing them of its contents. He then double-checked the recipient's email address and clicked the send button.   As soon as the message was sent, John received an automated response from ABC Enterprises, confirming the receipt of the proposal. He breathed a sigh of relief and went back to his daily work, reassured that the ball was now in his client's court. This simple but crucial exchange of documents by email saved John the hassle and expense of printing and physically delivering hard copies of the proposal, which could have delayed the approval process altogether. John knew that in today's fast-paced business world, speed and efficiency were key to success, and he was glad that he could rely on the convenience of email to get the job done.
