SCENARIO: It was a cold and rainy evening when Rachel arrived at her apartment complex after a long day at work. She was exhausted and just wanted to relax in her cozy apartment, but as she turned the key to her front door, she noticed something wasn't quite right. The doorknob was loose and the door wouldn't open. Frustrated and damp from the rain, Rachel knew she had to report this maintenance issue as soon as possible. She quickly pulled out her phone and opened her email, composing a message to the building's management team. She outlined the problem with her door, including a detailed description of the issue and the specific location, and also mentioned a few other minor issues, such as a leaky faucet and flickering lights. She hit send and sighed in relief, knowing that her message would be taken seriously and that someone would be on their way to fix her door and other issues. She didn't want to put up with these inconveniences any longer, especially as she paid a monthly maintenance fee for exactly this type of service. With her email sent, Rachel curled up on her couch with a hot cup of tea and a good book, grateful that she could count on her building's management team to address her concerns promptly.
