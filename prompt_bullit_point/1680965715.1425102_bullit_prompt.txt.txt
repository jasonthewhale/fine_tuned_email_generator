SCENARIO: As he sat at his desk, Thomas scrolled through his inbox, pausing when he saw an email from his church. They were seeking volunteers to promote educational opportunities offered through the church - classes, workshops, and seminars on topics like theology, marriage, and parenting. Thomas felt a surge of excitement. As a new father who was always striving to deepen his faith, these courses would benefit him in more ways than one. He began drafting a reply, eager to offer his time and resources to help promote such a valuable opportunity within his community. He included his name, contact information, and even offered to set up a meeting to discuss the details. As he hit send, Thomas couldn't help but feel an immense sense of fulfillment - not just for himself, but for others in the congregation who would have the chance to improve their lives through education and faith.
