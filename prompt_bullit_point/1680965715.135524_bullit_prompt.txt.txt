Given the following scenario, brainstorm a list of bullet points to include in the email. Bullet points should include topics such as TO, FROM, SUBJECT, intentions, goals, tone, and so on. Be creative as this is an imaginary scenario!

SCENARIO: Emily sat at her desk, typing away at her computer. She had just been put in charge of planning the upcoming worship services at her church, and she knew that it was going to take a lot of work to get everything organized. Looking down at her notes, she started drafting an email to the church's choir director, Sarah. She began by introducing herself and explaining her new role in the church, then went on to describe the responsibilities she had been given. Emily explained that she was hoping to work closely with Sarah to plan each Sunday's music selections and coordinate rehearsals for the choir members and any other musicians who would be playing during the services. She also asked if Sarah had any recommendations for songs or any other advice that might be helpful. After finishing the email, Emily hit send and leaned back in her chair, feeling a sense of satisfaction. She knew that there was still a lot of work to do, but reaching out to Sarah was the first step towards making sure that the church's worship services were both meaningful and musically sound.
