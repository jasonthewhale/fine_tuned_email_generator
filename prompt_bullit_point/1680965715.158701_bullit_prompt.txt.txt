SCENARIO: Samantha sat down at her computer, eager to write an email to her family members and close friends. She had been thinking about all the delicious meals they had shared over the years, and she wanted to keep those traditions alive. She started by greeting everyone warmly and asking how they were doing, and then she got down to business. Samantha explained that she had been thinking about how they used to swap recipes and cooking tips, and she wanted to bring that back. She suggested that they all share some of their favorite family recipes, and even plan out meals for events or gatherings. Samantha anticipated that this would be a great way for everyone to reconnect, and reminisce about old times. She hoped that everyone would be as excited as she was, and look forward to sharing delicious meals together again. With a final flourish, Samantha hit the send button, feeling optimistic and excited about the response she would get.
